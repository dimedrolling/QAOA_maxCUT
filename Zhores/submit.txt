-------------------------BELOW IS THE INSTRUCTIONS------------------------------


Connecting to Zhores:
download cisco any connect to your computer and connect to vpn-zh.skoltech.ru
put the credentials that were sent to your email.

open the terminal if you are on linux/macos or download putty or mobaXterm if you are on windows
follow the instructions that were sent to your email to connect from the terminal

      2. Jupyter notebook
in your code take the inputs as system arguments (see example notebook)
save your program as a python file. in Jupyter notebook click File > Download as > Python (.py)

      3. Uploading your code to  zhores
in the terminal and connected to zhores, make a directory by typing: mkdir <name of the directory>
to see the files in a directory type: ls
to get into a directory you created by typing: cd <name>
make two directories named:
 logs: here will be saved any python output
data_logs: here will be saved the .csv files that your code will output

     4. Copying files from your computer to Zhores 

open a new terminal and write: 

scp <file directory>/<file> username@domain:<directory in zhores>/

example:

scp /home/ernesto/Pictures/boxes.png e.campos@cdise.login:/trinity/home/e.campos/boxes/

Note: if you are not sure of the name of a directory use the command: pwd

send to zhores your .py file and the submission script(included in the examples)

   5) setting stuff to run code in Zhores
modify the submission script. To do so type: nano sumbmit_compiler.sh
modify the script  to work with your code by changing  the directory where the .csv files will be saved R=<directory> 
save the changes


      6) Running stuff
run the example by typing: 
sbatch -J name submission_script.sh arguments

example: 

sbatch -J 3q4p submition_compiler.sh 3 4

This sends 40 jobs to Zhores (this can be seen from the submit_compiler.sh while in nano), with 3 qubits and 4 layers.

you can check the status of your jobs by typing: squeue
you can cancel the jobs by typing: scancel -n <user>@<domain>

if you want to submit multiple jobs for a range of certain parameter e.g. 1 to 3 layers, it can be done by typing:

for i in {1..3}; do `sbatch -J ${i}p submit_compiler.sh 3 ${i}`; done

    7) checking for problems
if you encounter any problems, go to the logs folder and type ls.
open any of the files with cat <filename>
if there was any error with the program it will be displayed there

      8) downloading the data
when your jobs have finished you can download the files using scp
scp username@domain:<directory in zhores>/ <file directory>/<filename>

Note: to copy all files in a given directory use 
scp username@domain:<directory in zhores>/ <file directory>/*.* 
	
here * stands for all possible names and extensions, therefore *.* will copy all files in a given directory
